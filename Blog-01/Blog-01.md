In TypeScript, union and intersection types are useful for flexibility and type safety. Both allows us to make complex types for maintainable code.

Union Types:
A union type can hold more than one type. This is helpful when a value one of sever types, make code flexible and type safety.

Why is it  Useful?
I can write functions that accept different types with safety.
TypeScript ensure pass allowed types, give flexibility.


Intersection Types:
An intersection type combines multiple types into one. This is helpful when you want a single type that includes properties from several other types.

Why is it  Useful?
Useful when I need an object to have multiple sets of properties.
Ensures objects meet all required type definitions.
